# 1crmRawTemplateEditor
A module to enable a JSON-Editor for editing PDF Templates (Expert knowledge required!)

# Warning
- If you haven't heard of JSON or do not know programming: DO NOT USE THIS MODULE! Upgrade to 1CRM Enterprise instead and use the official PDF Designer!
- If you use this module anyhow, you will be on your own with every PDF related problem in 1CRM. visual4 won't help and 1CRM corp neither!
- PDF Templates are regenerated by the maintenance methods in administration, on 1CRM updates, on module installation. Every time this happens, your changes from within this module are lost!
- there is no security measure in this module. Every 1CRM user who knows that the module can be accessed by entering index.php?module=v4RawTemplates will be able to edit your templates
- Probability is very high, that changes in PDF JSON code will make your PDF template un-usable.
- Backup, Backup, Backup!

This module adds a JSON Editor to 1CRM. With this editor, the JSON configuration for all PDF templates can be modified.
